This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Small project
Using React create an autocomplete that searches for products in an array(array will soon connect to either a JSON API or straight to a database)

Top search result is a quick mockup using react to do a search results 

The Bottom search result is using react-autocomplete library
this is more customizable and you are able to group results

Both search results still need to work in a multidimensional array
